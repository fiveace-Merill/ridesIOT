                <h3>Road Bikes</h3>
                <p>If you’re staying on pavement, it’s hard to beat the fast-rolling efficiency of a good road bike. From racing to group rides to solo spins, a road bike can handle a wide range of recreational rides.</p>

                <h3>Mountain Bikes</h3>
                <p>These durable, rugged bikes are made for riding narrow dirt trails. They have wide and flat handlebars for control, two-inch or wider tires with knobby tread for traction, and wide-range drivetrains and hydraulic disc brakes for handling steep climbs and descents. Most modern mountain bikes have 29-inch wheels, with the occasional model using 27.5-inch wheels (MX or Mullet bikes run a 29er in the front with a 27.5 in the rear). The older 26-inch is rapidly disappearing but is still used for some kids and dirt jump mountain bikes.</p>

                <h3>E-bike</h3>
                <p>The “e” stands for a small electric motor that assists the rider’s pedaling effort. There are three classes: Class 1: pedal-assist to 20 mph; Class 2: pedal-assist or throttle-driven to 20 mph; and Class 3: pedal-assist to 28 mph. Once found mostly on urban bikes, you can find electric bikes now across almost all kinds of bikes.</p>

                <h3>BMX</h3>
                <p>Short for “bicycle motocross” BMX bikes were created in the early 1970s for racing on motocross-style courses. As the sport exploded in popularity, freestyle bikes designed for riding on ramps and dirt jumps or doing tricks on streets and in skateparks emerged. BMX riding has a strong and established subculture.</p>
